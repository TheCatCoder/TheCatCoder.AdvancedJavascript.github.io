      "info": "This is me with the rest of the band that I play in. Violin is one of the instruments that I play in it. I've been playing since I was 16. I mostly play an electric violin, since that's much easier to consistantly amplify to the rest of the band's level"

      "info": "I love spending time with my little guy. He's almost 10 months old now. I love strolling him around, and just being with him in different settings. A child's natural curiosity about everything around them is a great reminder of what it means to discover and learn."

      "info": "I first had an interest in coding about 6 years ago after I watched a programmer compile a program from source on my linux computer. After seeing the magic of how computers turn commands and source code into software that you can interact with, I haven't been able to get enough ever since."

      "info": "I love video games. I probably prefer PC gaming out of everything, but I also have a Wii U that I love to play various Zelda games on. Even though, I prefer PC gaming, I don't commonly use a mouse and keyboard to play; these are the 3 controllers that I use instead."

      "title": "Visiting England",
      "info": "I'm half joking with this one. Obviously I don't go to England that often because it's very expensive to do that, but my wife Amy, who can be seen in this photo, is from England; so we go there every couple of years. Leeds Castle is what you see in the background."
