					<p>The core of this class was to simply learn how to use the jQuery and Bootstrap libraries. However, 
						because of the ease of the class's required material, I was able to dive deeper into using JavaScript API's and investigating their documentation. 
						Outside of the class's projects, I made my first GitHub contribution to an Electron powered menu bar podcast app called Undercast. 
						My contribution involved implementing a dark mode using JavaScript powered CSS injection. I learned a lot about reading documentation and 
						generally figuring out how to solve problems within a given framework. I then chose to build on that knowledge by making my own Electron powered podcast app 
						that I thought would be more useful for my purposes. I like to game while listening to podcasts on my PC, so I created an Electron wrapper for Overcast.com, 
						which is the web app for the Overcast app for iOS, an excellent podcast app. My wrapper allowed you to navigate the web UI completely with an Xbox One Controller. 
						It used the same concepts as my github contribution, with the app&#39;s special features mainly being powered by CSS injections via JavaScript. My app is called 
						&quot;Overcast for Gamers&quot;.</p>
						
						<p>I've also put the list of projects I worked on below. They are mostly proof of concept level webpages, lacking a lot of polish that I would have wanted to be 
							there if they had any purpose beside helping me learn the jQuery and Bootstrap API's.</p>
